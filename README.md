# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Logistic-Regression
• Built a binary classification model using logistic regression to predict risk of cardiovascular diseases in humans 
• Performed data imputations using KNN imputer and feature scaling to normalize the data for further analysis 
• Implemented backward elimination (p-value approach) to select only significant features for the response variable 
• Obtained the model of best fit with sensitivity = 0.577, specificity = 0.6315 and F1 score = 0.60
